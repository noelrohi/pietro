# Commitment Ladder

## Intent

Build psychological commitment through escalating micro-yeses before asking for the macro-yes (payment). Based on foot-in-the-door technique and cognitive dissonance theory.

## The psychology

When users say "yes" to small requests:
1. They see themselves as "the type of person who says yes to this"
2. Saying "no" to related larger requests creates cognitive dissonance
3. They resolve dissonance by continuing to say "yes"

## Ladder structure

```
[RHETORICAL QUESTIONS] → [RITUAL MOMENT] → [JOURNEY INITIATION]
      3-4 screens           1 screen          1-2 screens
```

## Rhetorical questions

**Goal:** Get 3-4 consecutive "yes" answers to questions designed to only have one reasonable answer.

### Question design rules

1. Question must feel profound, not manipulative
2. "No" must feel like giving up on yourself
3. Each question escalates commitment slightly
4. Use aspirational imagery that matches user's stated goals

### Fitness app sequence

|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Is there a version of yourself you dream of becoming?" | Everyone has aspirations |
| 2 | "Are you willing to challenge your own limits to grow?" | Growth mindset is valued |
| 3 | "Do you believe small changes can lead to big transformations?" | Compound effect is logical |
| 4 | "Would you invest in yourself if you knew it could change your life?" | Self-investment is virtuous |

### Productivity app sequence

| # | Question | Why it works |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Do you believe you're capable of more than you're currently achieving?" | Universal feeling |
| 2 | "Are you ready to stop letting distractions control your day?" | Autonomy is valued |
| 3 | "Do you believe the right system can unlock your potential?" | Systems > willpower |
| 4 | "Would you commit to yourself if you had a clear path forward?" | Clarity removes barriers |

### Learning app sequence

| # | Question | Why it works |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Do you believe your potential is greater than your current skills?" | Growth mindset |
| 2 | "Are you willing to invest time to become the expert you want to be?" | Time is learnable |
| 3 | "Do you believe consistent practice leads to mastery?" | 10,000 hours is known |
| 4 | "Would you bet on yourself if the path was clear?" | Self-belief is admirable |

### Finance app sequence

| # | Question | Why it works |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Do you believe you deserve financial peace of mind?" | Self-worth |
| 2 | "Are you ready to take control of where your money goes?" | Autonomy |
| 3 | "Do you believe small changes can lead to big financial outcomes?" | Compound effect |
| 4 | "Would you invest 5 minutes a day to secure your future?" | Low commitment ask |

### Dating/social app sequence

|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Do you believe you deserve a meaningful connection?" | Self-worth |
| 2 | "Are you ready to put yourself out there?" | Courage is valued |

| 4 | "Would you take a chance if it could change your life?" | Risk vs reward |

### Health/wellness app sequence (softer tone)

| # | Question | Why it works |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Do you believe understanding your body leads to better decisions?" | Knowledge = power |
| 2 | "Are you ready to prioritize your wellbeing?" | Self-care is virtuous |
| 3 | "Do you believe small daily habits create lasting change?" | Manageable commitment |

Note: Health apps should use 3 questions max, softer language, no dramatic ritual.

### Professional/B2B app sequence

| # | Question | Why it works |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | "Is your current workflow costing you time you can't get back?" | Pain point |
| 2 | "Do you believe the right tools can multiply your output?" | Tools = leverage |
| 3 | "Are you ready to work smarter, not harder?" | Efficiency is valued |

Note: Skip the ritual for B2B - go straight to value/ROI demonstration.

## Ritual moment

**Goal:** Create a physical action that feels like a binding commitment.

### When to use rituals

| Category | Ritual appropriate? | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Fitness/Self-improvement | Yes | Full theatrical ritual works |
| Learning/Education | Light | Simple swipe or tap, no mysticism |
| Finance | Light | "Commit to your goal" - simple hold |
| Dating/Social | Moderate | "Take the leap" - swipe gesture |
| Health/Wellness | No | Skip ritual, feels manipulative |
| Productivity/B2B | No | Skip ritual, unprofessional |

## Post-commitment sign-in

**Goal:** Capture account after commitment, framed as "saving progress."

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Sign in to save your data     │
│        Or skip for now          │
│                                 │
│    [Character holding           │
│     "SAVING DATA..." display]   │
│                                 │
│    [  Continue with Apple ]     │
│                                 │
│  By continuing, you agree to    │
│  our Terms and Privacy Policy   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Framing:** "Save your progress" not "Create account"

## Timing

- Each question: 3-5 seconds (quick decisions)
- Ritual moment: 5-10 seconds (let gravity sink in)
- Journey initiation: 5-10 seconds (cinematic)
- Total commitment phase: 30-60 seconds

## Pitfalls

- Questions that users might reasonably say "no" to
- Ritual that feels gimmicky instead of meaningful
- Missing the journey initiation (anti-climactic)
- Asking for sign-in before commitment (breaks flow)
- "No" button that's too prominent (should be de-emphasized)
